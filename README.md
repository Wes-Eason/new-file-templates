# new-file-templates
Templates for creating new files easily

## What is this for?
Ubuntu, by default, gives users a folder in their home directory named
"Templates".  When a user then right-clicks in Nautilus and hovers over the "New
Document" option, a list of the items in their $HOME/Templates folder is
created.  Selecting an item from the list places a copy of the file in the
Templates directory into the folder they right-clicked on.  

The aim of this project is to provide some files to place in your 
$HOME/Templates folder, so that you can quickly and easily begin working on
projects without wasting time writing boiler plate code or navigating in
"Save As..." menus.
